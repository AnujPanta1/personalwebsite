            <h4 id = "slime">Physarum Slime Simulation</h4>
            <p>- using Physarum Slime behaivor I made a recreation of slime growth.
               The slimes naturally create a short path between themselves in a web
                like connection. Using this property I mapped various subway maps
                 and let the slimes figure out the best connections between subway terminals. The project
                was coded in Java, using the Processing library.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <h4 id = "chalk">Chalkboard</h4>
            <p>- inorder to learn more about both React and Firebase, I created Chalkboard 
              which essentially allows you to post something to the website, which is then 
              viewable by anyone in your "classroom". It uses react elements to display 
              most things, with most of the reacting going twoards display the boards themselves.
              Firebase stores who elese is in your class as well as all messages posted.

          <div class="body">
            <h4 id = "maze">Maze Generation + solver</h4>
            <p>- using Kruskal's algorithm I was able to aminate the fomatino of 
              a maze, allowing you to visually see how a maze is created. I also implemented the A* 
              path finding algorithm which then solves the newly generated maze. The gneration and path 
              finding is done in broswer using javascript and the animatino uses a js library called p5.js
