          <p>I'm a computer science currently at UC Berkeley!<br>
            I love learning about applications of computer science and building interactive or visual projects.<br>
            I've been working on full-stack development as well as simulations.

            <h4 id = "slime">Physarum Slime Simulation</h4>
            <p>- after reading a paper on Physarum Slime behavior I made a recreation of slime growth. 
              The slime replicated behavior written in the paper, creating beautiful patterns. It was a great project to 
              use Java as well as object-oriented programming. Currently, I'm working on expanding the project so 
              the slime can be used to map the shortest path between two points; hopefully mapping this to subway maps as a pseudo 
              pathfinding algorithm. The project was created using the Processing library. 
           </p>

          <div class="body">
            <h4 id = "chalk">Chalkboard</h4>
            <p>- to learn more about both React and Firebase, I created Chalkboard which essentially 
              allows you to post something to the website, which is then viewable by anyone in your 
              "classroom". It uses react elements to display most things, with most of the reacting going towards 
              displaying the boards themselves. Firebase stores who else is in your class, as well as all messages, posted. The project 
              allowed me to better understand full-stack development.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="body">
            <h4 id = "maze">Maze Generation + solver</h4>
            <p>- using Kruskal's algorithm I was able to aminate the formation of 
              a maze, allowing you to visually see how a maze is created. I also implemented the A* 
              pathfinding algorithm which then solves the newly generated maze. The generation and pathfinding 
              are done in the browser using javascript and the animation uses a library called p5.js.

          <div class="body">
            <h4 id = "noise">Perlin Noise</h4>
            <p>- I used Perlin noise to create a vector field and use particles to track trails.  A bit of time allows
              for a beautiful trace of the noise field. As time goes on the trail gets deeper and deeper. The simulation 
              works as a great background to a website, and allowed me to dabble into animations.

          </div>
          <div class="body">
            <h4 id = "balls">Mettaballs</h4>
            <p>- using the mathematic pricinples behind Metaballs I created a few floating objects that interact 
              with eachother as they move along. It's a smiple project to showcase my creative applications of code.
